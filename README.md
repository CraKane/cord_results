## PDF Description
The PDF presents the visualization of role distributions for all agents within CORD across four stages of an episode. We visualize the role assignment by reducing the original model's output role vector to a two-dimensional plane using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Each point represents an agent, with the point's position indicating the spatial location of the agent's current role assignment.
